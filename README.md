## Flow Expense Tracker

Our app uses sequelize to create user private user accounts to create spending records for each user. 

Users can then track spending via individual reciepts or by outputing to various charts (via chart.js) to give big picture impressions of spending habits. Some examples are need Vs want spending, analysis by category (rent, groceries) and totals.
